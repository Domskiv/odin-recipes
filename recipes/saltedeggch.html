 <h3>Desription</h3>
 <p>
    Salted Egg Yolk Chicken is a beloved Singapore and Malaysian zi char restaurant/hawker dish of 
    <br>fried chicken bites slathered in a creamy, sweet and savoury salted egg yolk sauce.  This is also so 
    <br>incredibly easy to make at home. I used chicken here, but this recipe works with squid and prawns as well. 
    <br> I made a Salted Egg Yolk Calamari a while back, and this recipe is even easier to make!
